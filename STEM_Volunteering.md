# Stuff to Consider BEFORE You Volunteer

Start with training. Not exciting, but if we're going to impact the community, let's make sure we do it right. We're tech professionals, and not education professionals, so let's take some tips from them.

As cybersecurity professionals, we don't want to be out there spreading FUD because our industry does incline itself towards it. [A single opinion on FUD, but there's plenty more out there](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3302849/why-security-pros-are-addicted-to-fud-and-what-you-can-do-about-it.html)

The EFF's [Security Education Companion](https://sec.eff.org/) has a very thoughtful perspective on becoming a community educator. Make sure you catch the emphasis on the [harm reduction approach](https://sec.eff.org/articles/harm-reduction).

Furthermore, if you're working with impressionable young people, esp URMs, there's more training available:
- [Girl Day at UT Training](https://girlday.utexas.edu/messaging-and-role-models) has a great summary
- [Tech Bridge Girls' Role Models Matter](https://www.techbridgegirls.org/rolemodelsmatter/toolkit/) is very comprehensive

# Be Thoughtful about Commitment

Think about what kind of commitment you're looking for. Recurring commitments are the hardest to make, but so impactful and many organizations need them. One time opportunities for an individual? Check! One time opportunities for a group? Check! Donations? Check!!! 

# Making a difference in Central Texas

## Methods of Finding Opportunities
[TX Stem Connections](https://txstemconnections.nepris.com) - Also has virtual opportunities!
[Volunteer Match](https://www.volunteermatch.org/) - Has many non-STEM opportunities too
[Greater Austin STEM Ecosystem Meetups](https://greateraustinstemecosystem.org/events/) - A great place to make connections of varying types (mostly non-profit) with folks in the STEM space.

Your Local Libraries
Austin Public Library and RR Public Library both have STEM program coordinators.

## Unsure about getting in front of kids? 

Help out local non-profits with your tech or business skills. Be an IT volunteer or a board member!
- What does being on a non-profit board entail? Mission Capital has workshops on that! 
https://www.missioncapital.org/
- Alternatively, reach out to your local library and reach adults in the community. Talk about basic Internet safety or give workshops - utilize the EFF's resources!
